      "Despite their seeming interchangeability, the difference between these two is greater than one may think. Web design looks to ensure the visual aesthetics and usability of a website or an app — basically, to make your website both pleasant to look at and easy to use. The idea and brand identity become more tangible through the use of color schemes, images, fonts and typography, layout, information flow and architecture, along with anything else related to the visual aspects of the UI/UX (user interface and user experience). It takes web development to bring this digital experience to life by building a website’s core structure by means of coding languages. Making sure an app is fast and responsive, the code is clean and coherent, user data is properly tracked and securely stored — everything that’s taking place “under the hood” lies within the scope of web development.",

Cross-platform apps are significantly less resource-intensive and time-consuming. If what you’re going for is to deliver a project with basic straightforward functionality, validate a hypothesis, reduce time-to-market, reach potential customers, or increase conversion a cross-platform mobile application will do the trick.

Native mobile applications are faster and more responsive, but are labor-intensive and take longer to build. From the user's point of view, a native application is no different from a well-executed cross-platform one, but it’s still worth noting that native apps for a specific mobile OS usually have a user-friendly, native interface. As a result, the user intuitively interacts with the new application right from the moment she opens it. If what you’re going for is flexibility, a more advanced user experience and interface, and a greater number of features it’s the native mobile development that wins.`,
